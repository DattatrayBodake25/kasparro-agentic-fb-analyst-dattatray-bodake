##  Overview

This project implements a **multi-agent system** that autonomously diagnoses Facebook Ads performance, identifies causes behind **ROAS fluctuations**, and recommends **new creative directions** using both quantitative and creative data insights.

The system simulates an **agentic marketing analyst** â€” capable of planning, reasoning, validating hypotheses, and generating data-driven creative recommendations.

---

##  Objectives

The system is designed to:

- Diagnose **why ROAS changed** over time.
- Identify **drivers** behind changes (e.g., audience fatigue, creative underperformance).
- Propose **new creative ideas** for low-CTR campaigns.
- Generate an **end-to-end report** summarizing analysis, insights, and recommendations.
